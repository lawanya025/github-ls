Learning  shell scripting was comparatively a faster process to learn. I understood the concepts quickly as it was related to the commands which we used in the Git bash system. The introduction included the basic codes for performing different tasks such as the meaning rwx, #!=shebang, chmod +x (file name) for adding executable permission and many more which we also used in our Git bash. Further we understand the basic knowledge about variables, importance of capitalization, adding comments. We further learn about built in variable in shell scripting.
