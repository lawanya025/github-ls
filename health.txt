Prospects of Artificial Intelligence discusses AI's future applications. As reading through the paper, the person gains knowledge about an AI-assisted blockchain-based architecture for storing and processing medical records in the Electronic Medical Record system to generate a comprehensive patient medical history report. This architecture also safeguards medical records and allows emergency retrieval.
User interfaces further allow document registration and submission. Medical practitioners can review a patient's medical history. Technology updates the patient's medical history.
IPFS stores files, blockchain links data, and a machine learning algorithm processes data. The front end's GUI here simplifies document uploads and access. IPFS stores files, blockchain hash values. Machine learning retrieves useful info from files.
This approach comprises 5G technology, decentralised and secure EMR storage, and OCR-generated patient history synopses. Doctors can use the EMR system more efficiently and patients can manage their medical data with the framework.
Thus In the proposed architecture, blockchain, AI, and machine learning secure medical records. Enhance healthcare intelligence and usability.
In the next paper we learn about EMR as an AI system foundation.  AI and EMR data improve hospital operations and patient care worldwide. EMRs feature diagnoses, prescriptions, tests, allergies, immunisations, treatment plans, and customised medical care. These basically improve healthcare. AI can create drugs, predict illnesses, and customise treatments using EMR data. EMR data for AI research must be handled carefully due to patient data sensitivity. Patient confidentiality requires balancing data security and clinical use. To use EMR data properly, researchers should leverage Korean government help. Research and AI prediction models need disease definitions and data quality control. Artificial intelligence analysis of natural language or medical shorthand medical records requires preprocessing. EMR-AI integration can personalise healthcare management, improve delivery, and create AI-generated drugs. This highlights data uniformity, privacy, and medical practitioner-data analyst teamwork. In conclusion, AI-synchronized and controlled electronic medical record data improves healthcare and patient well-being.
