BASISCS OF CODING IN PYTHON
In the course ‘Python for beginners’, we started with the introduction explaining how Python works and the various tasks that can be accomplished using Python, such as machine learning, web development, etc. It was a condensed version of what we had learned in the first video, excluding the assignments. Further, the lecture covers the concept of variables in Python, explaining that they can hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, and booleans. It demonstrates how to use variables, including input values from the user. The lecturer shows examples of variable manipulation, such as performing arithmetic operations and type conversion.
Next we study string manipulation introducing various string methods like upper(), lower(), find(), and replace(). It explains how to perform string concatenation. We further look into comparison operators, logical operators, and if statements, demonstrating their usage in conditional statements.
We performed exercises based on if-else and while statements, for loops. Learning concluded with the range() function and tuples.
